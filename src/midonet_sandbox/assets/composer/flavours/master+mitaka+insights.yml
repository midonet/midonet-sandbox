# This flavour contains two insights containers not available on
# the artifactory (yet) and not available on this project. To build
# them you must:
#
# - Clone: http://github.com/midokura/insights-cloud
# - Then:
# 1: You have docker-compose client with version 3 compatibility
#    (1.11 onwards):
#   - $ docker-compose build
# 2: You don't have docker-compose client with versino 3 compatibility:
#   - $ cd backend/sandbox && docker build -t midonet-insights:backend
#   - $ cd -
#   - $ cd gateway/sandbox && docker build -t midonet-insights:gateway
